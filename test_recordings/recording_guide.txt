DAWN ASR Baseline Test Recording Guide
================================================================================

Instructions:
- Speak clearly at normal volume
- Record in your typical usage environment
- Vary speech rate (normal, fast, slow)
- Include some background noise scenarios
- Use the command: arecord -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 16000 -d <seconds> test_XXX.wav

Recording duration guide:
- Short utterances: -d 5 (5 seconds)
- Medium utterances: -d 10 (10 seconds)
- Long utterances: -d 15 (15 seconds)

RECORDING TIPS
================================================================================

1. Press Ctrl+C to stop recording early if you finish before the timer
2. Review your recording: aplay test_XXX.wav
3. Re-record if needed: just overwrite the file
4. Keep consistent naming: test_001.wav through test_055.wav
5. Take breaks - don't record all 55 in one session!
6. Note any issues in a separate notes.txt file

================================================================================
QUICK RECORDING WORKFLOW
================================================================================

# Record test_001
arecord -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 16000 -d 5 test_001.wav
<speak: "Friday">
<wait for completion or Ctrl+C>

# Verify recording
aplay test_001.wav

# If good, move to next
arecord -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 16000 -d 5 test_002.wav
<speak: "Okay Friday">

# Repeat for all tests...

# MQTT Setup Guide -- The OASIS Project

This guide covers the complete MQTT setup for all OASIS components: **DAWN** (AI assistant), **MIRAGE** (HUD), and **STAT** (telemetry). Configure the broker once, then point each client at it.

## 1. Install Mosquitto

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
systemctl status mosquitto
```

By default, Mosquitto listens on `127.0.0.1:1883` with no authentication. This is fine for a single-machine setup where all OASIS components run on the same Jetson. The steps below add authentication and encryption for hardened deployments.

---

## 2. Authentication

Create a password file with a shared user for all OASIS components:

```bash
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd oasis
# Enter a password when prompted
```

To add additional users (e.g., separate credentials per component):
```bash
sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd dawn
sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd mirage
```

> **Note**: Use `-c` only for the first user (it creates the file). Subsequent users use the command without `-c` to append.

---

## 3. TLS Certificates

Generate a private CA and broker certificate for encrypted MQTT.

### Create a certificate directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/mosquitto/certs
cd /etc/mosquitto/certs
```

### Generate CA (Certificate Authority)

```bash
sudo openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
sudo openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt \
  -subj "/CN=OASIS MQTT CA"
```

> **Tip**: If you already have a private CA from DAWN's SSL setup (`ssl/ca.crt`), you can reuse it here instead of creating a new one. Copy it to `/etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt`.

### Generate broker certificate

```bash
sudo openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

### Sign the broker certificate

The broker cert needs Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for all hostnames/IPs clients will use to connect:

```bash
# Get your machine's LAN IP
JETSON_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')

# Create SAN extension file
echo "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:${JETSON_IP}" | \
  sudo tee /etc/mosquitto/certs/san.cnf

# Sign the certificate
sudo openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 3650 \
  -extfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/san.cnf
```

### Set permissions

```bash
sudo chown mosquitto:mosquitto /etc/mosquitto/certs/*
sudo chmod 640 /etc/mosquitto/certs/*.key
```

---

## 4. Broker Configuration

Create the configuration file:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/oasis.conf << 'EOF'
# Authentication
allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

# Plain MQTT on localhost only (for local-only setups without TLS)
listener 1883 127.0.0.1

# TLS listener on all interfaces
listener 8883
certfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt
keyfile /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.key
cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
EOF
```

Restart and verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
systemctl status mosquitto

# Verify both listeners are active
ss -tlnp | grep -E '1883|8883'
```

You should see:
- `127.0.0.1:1883` -- authenticated plaintext (localhost only)
- `0.0.0.0:8883` -- authenticated + TLS (all interfaces)

> **Security note**: Once TLS is working, you can remove the plain listener by deleting the `listener 1883` line. For development, keeping both is convenient.

---

## 5. Client Configuration

All OASIS components support the same security features. Configure each one with the credentials created in step 2 and the CA certificate from step 3.

### DAWN

**Connection settings** in `dawn.toml`:

```toml
[mqtt]
enabled = true
broker = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8883
tls = true
tls_ca_cert = "/etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt"
# tls_cert_path = ""  # Only for mutual TLS (broker requires client cert)
# tls_key_path = ""   # Only for mutual TLS
```

**Credentials** in `secrets.toml`:

```toml
[secrets]
mqtt_username = "oasis"
mqtt_password = "your-password"
```

Or via environment variables:
```bash
export DAWN_MQTT_TLS=true
export DAWN_MQTT_PORT=8883
export DAWN_MQTT_TLS_CA_CERT="/etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt"
```

**Expected log output:**
```
[INFO] MQTT authentication configured for user: oasis
[INFO] MQTT TLS enabled (CA: /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt)
[INFO] Connected to local MQTT server.
```

### MIRAGE

**Connection settings** in `config.json`:

```json
"mqtt": {
   "host": "127.0.0.1",
   "port": 8883,
   "tls": true,
   "tls_ca_cert": "/etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt"
}
```

**Credentials** in `secrets.json`:

```json
{
   "mqtt_username": "oasis",
   "mqtt_password": "your-password"
}
```

**Expected log output:**
```
[INFO] MQTT authentication configured for user: oasis
[INFO] MQTT TLS enabled (CA: /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt)
[INFO] Connecting to MQTT broker at 127.0.0.1:8883
[INFO] Mosquitto successfully connected. Subscribing to...
```

### STAT

**Service mode** -- edit `/etc/oasis-stat/stat.conf` (or the local `config/stat.conf`):

```bash
MQTT_HOST=127.0.0.1
MQTT_PORT=8883
MQTT_TOPIC=stat
MQTT_USERNAME=oasis
MQTT_PASSWORD=your-password
MQTT_TLS=true
MQTT_CA_CERT=/etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
```

**CLI mode:**

```bash
oasis-stat --mqtt-host 127.0.0.1 --mqtt-port 8883 \
  --mqtt-username oasis --mqtt-password your-password \
  --mqtt-ca-cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
```

**Expected log output:**
```
MQTT: Authentication configured for user: oasis
MQTT: TLS enabled (CA: /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt)
MQTT: Connecting to broker at 127.0.0.1:8883
MQTT: Connected to broker
```

### stat-monitor (GUI)

```bash
python3 stat_monitor.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8883 \
  --username oasis --password your-password \
  --ca-cert /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
```

---

## 6. Verification

### Test with mosquitto CLI tools

```bash
# Test authenticated TLS connection (subscribe in background)
mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8883 \
  -u oasis -P 'your-password' \
  --cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt \
  -t 'test' -v &

# Publish a test message
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8883 \
  -u oasis -P 'your-password' \
  --cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt \
  -t 'test' -m 'hello from OASIS'

# You should see: test hello from OASIS
kill %1  # Stop the subscriber
```

### Verify cross-component communication

1. Start DAWN and MIRAGE
2. Check MIRAGE logs for: `Published hud status: online`
3. Check DAWN logs for: `Dawn is now ONLINE` or HUD discovery messages
4. Check MIRAGE logs for: `Received discovery request, republishing capabilities`

### Monitor all MQTT traffic (debugging)

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8883 \
  -u oasis -P 'your-password' \
  --cafile /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt \
  -t '#' -v
```

This subscribes to all topics. You'll see `hud/status`, `dawn/status`, `stat`, `hud/discovery/*`, and any sensor data flowing between components.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Connection refused

```
Error: Connection refused
```

- Check Mosquitto is running: `systemctl status mosquitto`
- Check the port is listening: `ss -tlnp | grep -E '1883|8883'`
- Check the broker log: `sudo tail -20 /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log`

### Authentication failure

```
Connection Refused: not authorised
```

- Verify credentials match the password file: `sudo mosquitto_passwd -U /etc/mosquitto/passwd`
- Check that `allow_anonymous false` is set in broker config
- Ensure the username/password in your component config match exactly

### TLS certificate errors

```
Error: Unable to load server certificate
OpenSSL Error: No such file or directory
```

- Verify cert files exist: `ls -la /etc/mosquitto/certs/`
- Check permissions: `sudo chown mosquitto:mosquitto /etc/mosquitto/certs/*`
- Regenerate if missing (see [step 3](#3-tls-certificates))

```
SSL routines: certificate verify failed
```

- The CA cert used by the client must be the same CA that signed the server cert
- Check SANs match the hostname you're connecting to: `openssl x509 -in /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt -text | grep -A1 "Subject Alternative"`
- If you changed the machine's IP, regenerate the server cert with updated SANs

### Mosquitto won't start after config changes

```bash
# Test config syntax
sudo mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf -v

# Common issues:
# - Missing cert files (check paths in oasis.conf)
# - Password file not found
# - Port already in use
```

### No data flowing between components

- Subscribe to all topics to see what's being published: `mosquitto_sub -t '#' -v ...`
- Check that components are subscribing to the correct topics (MIRAGE subscribes to `hud`, `helmet`, `stat`, armor topics)
- Check component status: look for `hud/status` and `dawn/status` messages
- Verify LWT is set: disconnect a component and watch for its offline status message

### Auth-only setup (no TLS)

For localhost-only deployments where encryption isn't needed, use port 1883 with just authentication:

**Broker** -- keep the `listener 1883 127.0.0.1` line in `oasis.conf` but remove or comment out the `listener 8883` block.

**Clients** -- set port to 1883, set `tls` to false (or omit it), and provide only username/password.

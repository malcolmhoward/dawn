 * @brief Silero VAD (Voice Activity Detection) ONNX Runtime wrapper
 *
 * This module provides a C interface to the Silero VAD model for detecting
 * speech activity in audio streams. It uses ONNX Runtime for inference.
 *
 * The Silero VAD model outputs a probability (0.0-1.0) indicating the
 * likelihood that the audio contains speech. Higher values indicate speech,
 * lower values indicate silence or non-speech audio.
 *
 * **Four Use Cases:**
 * 1. Wake word detection (SILENCE → WAKEWORD_LISTEN when speech_prob > 0.5)
 * 2. Speech end detection (silence > 1.5s indicates command complete)
 * 3. Pause detection (silence > 0.5s for chunking boundaries)
 * 4. Interruption detection (speech_prob > 0.6 while TTS playing)
 *
 * **Performance:**
 * - Model size: ~1.8MB (half-precision ONNX)
 * - Inference latency: <1ms on Jetson platforms
 * - Input: 512 samples (32ms at 16kHz)
 * - Output: Single float (speech probability)

 * @brief Reset VAD internal state

 * Clears the LSTM hidden and cell state to prevent past audio from

 * **When to reset:**
 * - State transitions to SILENCE or WAKEWORD_LISTEN from any other state
 * - After interruption detection (before processing new command)
 * - On command timeout (before returning to idle)
 * - When starting a new wake word detection cycle
 *
 * **Why this matters:**
 * The Silero VAD model maintains internal state (LSTM memory) that
 * accumulates over consecutive audio frames. Without resets, speech
 * from a previous interaction can bias detection in the current
 * interaction, leading to increased false positives or negatives.

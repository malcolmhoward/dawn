/**
 * @file calculator.h
 * @brief Calculator tool for DAWN voice assistant.
 *
 * Provides math evaluation, unit conversion, base conversion, and random
 * number generation capabilities accessible via voice commands and LLM integration.
 *
 * @section thread_safety Thread Safety
 * All functions are thread-safe:
 * - Uses pthread_once for one-time initialization
 * - No shared mutable state between calls
 * - Returns heap-allocated strings (caller must free)
 *
 * @section memory Memory Management
 * All functions returning char* return heap-allocated strings.
 * The caller is responsible for freeing the returned memory.
 *
 * @note Random number generation uses standard rand() which is not
 * cryptographically secure. Do not use for security-critical operations.

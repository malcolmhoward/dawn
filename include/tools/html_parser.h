 * HTML Parser - Convert HTML to Markdown
 *
 * This module extracts readable text content from HTML and converts it
 * to well-formatted Markdown. It handles:
 * - Headings (h1-h6)
 * - Bold/italic text
 * - Links (with relative URL resolution)
 * - Lists (ordered and unordered, nested)
 * - Code blocks and inline code
 * - Blockquotes
 * - Tables (simplified)
 * - HTML entity decoding
 *
 * Thread Safety: Functions in this module are thread-safe as they use only
 * stack-local state and caller-provided output buffers.
 *
 * Initialization: This module is stateless and requires no initialization
 * or cleanup. Each function call is independent and self-contained.

/*
 * DAWN Network Audio - IPC Bridge for Network Client Processing
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *   Provides Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between the network server
 *   thread and the main application's state machine thread for processing
 *   audio from remote ESP32 clients.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 *   - Server thread receives audio from ESP32 client
 *   - Callback (dawn_process_network_audio) stores audio in global buffer
 *   - Main thread polls for network_audio_ready flag
 *   - Main thread processes audio in NETWORK_PROCESSING state
 *   - Main thread stores result in processing_result_data global
 *   - Callback thread wakes up and returns result to server
 *   - Server thread sends result to ESP32 and frees memory
 *
 * THREADING MODEL:
 *   This is a SINGLE-CLIENT design. Only one network client can be
 *   processed at a time. The callback blocks the server thread waiting
 *   for the main thread to complete processing.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 *   - Blocks main state machine during network processing
 *   - Only one client can be serviced at a time
 *   - Second client gets echo fallback if first is still processing
 *   - Local microphone input ignored during network processing
 *
 * FUTURE WORK:
 *   See dawn_multi_client_architecture.md for the worker thread design
 *   that will replace this IPC mechanism.
 *
 * MEMORY OWNERSHIP:
 *   - network_audio_buffer: Owned by this module, freed on cleanup
 *   - processing_result_data: Allocated in dawn.c, freed in dawn_server.c
 *                             (passed through this module as pointer)
 *
 * SYNCHRONIZATION:
 *   - network_audio_mutex: Protects network_audio_buffer and related state
 *   - processing_mutex: Protects processing_result_data and completion flag
 *   - processing_done: Condition variable signaled by main thread

/**
 * Audio processor callback - IPC bridge between server and main thread
 *
 * EXECUTION MODEL:
 *   1. Server thread receives audio from ESP32 client
 *   2. Server thread calls this function (entry point)
 *   3. Audio is copied to global buffer (network_audio_buffer)
 *   4. Flag is set to notify main thread (network_audio_ready = 1)
 *   5. **THIS FUNCTION BLOCKS** waiting for main thread
 *   6. Main thread detects flag in state machine loop
 *   7. Main thread transitions to NETWORK_PROCESSING state
 *   8. Main thread processes: Vosk → LLM → TTS
 *   9. Main thread stores result in processing_result_data
 *  10. Main thread signals condition variable (processing_done)
 *  11. This function wakes up and returns result pointer
 *  12. Server thread sends result to ESP32 and frees pointer
 *
 * BLOCKING BEHAVIOR:
 *   This function BLOCKS the server thread for up to
 *   NETWORK_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_SEC seconds waiting for the main
 *   thread to complete processing. During this time, no new
 *   client connections can be accepted.
 *
 * SINGLE CLIENT LIMITATION:
 *   Only one client can be processed at a time due to global
 *   buffers. If called while another client is processing, the
 *   previous client's data will be overwritten (race condition).
 *
 * MEMORY OWNERSHIP:
 *   INPUT:  audio_data is owned by caller, not modified or freed
 *   OUTPUT: Return value is allocated in dawn.c by main thread
 *           CALLER (dawn_server.c) MUST free using free()
 *
 *   Memory flow: dawn.c (allocate) → this function (pass) →
 *                dawn_server.c (free)
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 *   - Returns echo of input on timeout (malloc'd copy)
 *   - Returns NULL on allocation failure
 *   - Always logs reason for fallback/failure
 *
 * @param audio_data    [IN]  Received WAV audio (read-only)

/**
 * @file chunking_manager.h
 * @brief Intelligent audio chunking for Whisper long utterances
 *
 * The chunking manager handles VAD-driven pause detection to split long
 * utterances into manageable chunks for Whisper ASR. It accumulates audio,
 * detects natural sentence boundaries (pauses), and concatenates the
 * transcribed chunks for seamless command processing.
 *
 * **Design Rationale:**
 * - Whisper processes audio in batches (not streaming)
 * - Long utterances (>30s) exceed optimal processing time
 * - Natural pauses (>0.5s) indicate sentence boundaries
 * - Chunking reduces latency and improves responsiveness
 *
 * **Integration:**
 * - Used exclusively with Whisper (asr_engine == ASR_ENGINE_WHISPER)
 * - Integrates with VAD pause detection (0.5s silence)
 * - Mediates all ASR interactions when active
 *
 * **Thread Safety:**
 * - NOT thread-safe (matches asr_context_t constraints)
 * - Call from same thread as ASR processing
 *
 * **Lifecycle:**
 * - Create once in main() for persistent use
 * - Reset between utterances (chunking_manager_reset)
 * - Cleanup on application exit

 * Vosk's streaming architecture.

 * - Calls asr_finalize() to process buffered audio
 * - Calls asr_reset() to clear buffer for next chunk
 * - Safe to call mid-utterance (Whisper is stateless per-chunk)

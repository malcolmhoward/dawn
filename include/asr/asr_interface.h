/**
 * @file asr_interface.h
 * @brief Unified ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) abstraction layer
 *
 * This interface provides a polymorphic dispatch system for multiple ASR engines,
 * allowing runtime selection between Vosk and Whisper without code changes.
 *
 * **THREAD SAFETY:**
 * - asr_context_t is NOT thread-safe
 * - Do NOT share a single context across multiple threads
 * - Create separate contexts for concurrent sessions (e.g., per network client)
 * - Thread-local or mutex-protected access required if sharing unavoidable
 *
 * **MEMORY MANAGEMENT:**
 * - Caller owns asr_result_t and must call asr_result_free()
 * - Context owns internal buffers and engine state
 * - Call asr_cleanup() to free all context resources
 *
 * **BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES:**
 * - Vosk: Supports streaming partial results (real-time transcription)
 * - Whisper: Batch processing only (returns empty partials, final result at finalize)

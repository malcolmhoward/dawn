 * Audio Resampler for DAWN
 *
 * Provides high-quality sample rate conversion using libsamplerate.
 * Used primarily to convert TTS output (22050Hz) to AEC reference (16kHz).
 *
 * Design Constraints:
 * - Pre-allocated buffers (no malloc in processing path)
 * - Fixed maximum chunk size to bound memory usage
 * - Thread-safe per-instance (each thread should have its own resampler)

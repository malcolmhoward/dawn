 * AEC Delay Calibration Module
 *
 * Measures the acoustic delay from speaker to microphone using cross-correlation
 * of TTS reference signal and microphone input during boot greeting playback.
 * This provides accurate delay hints to the AEC processor for optimal echo
 * cancellation performance.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Call aec_cal_init() at startup with sample rate and max delay to search
 * 2. Call aec_cal_start() when TTS greeting playback begins
 * 3. Route reference samples through aec_cal_add_reference() during playback
 * 4. Route mic samples through aec_cal_add_mic() during capture
 * 5. Call aec_cal_finish() when playback ends to get measured delay
 * 6. Use measured delay to update AEC delay hint via aec_set_delay_hint()
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - aec_cal_add_reference(): Safe to call from TTS thread
 * - aec_cal_add_mic(): Safe to call from capture thread
 * - Other functions: Call from main thread only

 * Memory Similarity API
 *
 * Provides text normalization, hashing, and similarity scoring for
 * fact deduplication. Uses a multi-stage algorithm:
 *
 * 1. Normalization: Lowercase, remove stopwords, sort words alphabetically
 * 2. Hash check: FNV-1a hash for O(1) exact duplicate detection
 * 3. Jaccard similarity: For fuzzy matching when hashes differ
 *
 * The normalized form is used for comparison but original text is preserved.

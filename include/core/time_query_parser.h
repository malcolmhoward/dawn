 * Time Query Parser — extract temporal references from natural-language
 * search queries.  Used by retrieval to boost facts/chunks whose created_at
 * is near the user's referenced point in time.
 *
 * Recognized expressions (in specificity order — first match wins):
 *   month + year          "September 2022", "in May 2020", "January 2019"
 *   season + year         "summer 2021", "winter 2020", "fall 2022"
 *   ISO-8601 dates        "2020-03-15" (±1 day), "2022-11" (±15 days)
 *   N units ago           "5 days ago", "two weeks ago", "in the past 30 days"
 *   how many ago          "how many days ago" (recency hint, no explicit N)
 *   absolute year         "in 2020", "during 2021" (±180 days)
 *   yesterday / today     "yesterday", "today"
 *   last/this unit        "last week", "last month", "this year"
 *   bare month            "in September", "in May" (most recent past occurrence)
 *   vague                 "recently", "the other day"
 *
 * Returns a target timestamp (midpoint of the referenced window) plus the
 * window width so callers can score by Gaussian decay or hard-window match.

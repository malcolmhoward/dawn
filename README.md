# D.A.W.N. — Your Own Personal, Private AI Assistant

**D.A.W.N.** is the central intelligence layer of [The OASIS Project](https://github.com/The-OASIS-Project) — an open-source voice-controlled AI assistant built for embedded Linux hardware. Think JARVIS from *Iron Man*, but real: an always-listening, conversational AI that controls your smart home, answers questions, searches the web, plays music, and more — running on hardware you own.

DAWN was designed from the ground up to be the closest thing to a production-quality JARVIS that actually exists. It listens for a wake word, understands natural speech, reasons about your request, and responds in a natural voice — all in real time. It remembers you — your preferences, your routines, the people and things you care about — and gets better the more you use it. It can run entirely offline with a local LLM, or connect to cloud providers like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini. Multi-room satellite devices bring voice control to every room in your home, just like having JARVIS in every room of 10880 Malibu Point.

Unlike cloud-dependent assistants and plugin-based AI agents, DAWN runs entirely on your hardware. There is no extension marketplace, no third-party plugins, no arbitrary code execution. Every tool is compiled into the binary and audited at the source level. It can run fully offline — your voice, your data, your network, never leaving your home.

DAWN runs on platforms from a Jetson Orin to a Raspberry Pi 5 and supports multiple interfaces: a local microphone, a browser-based Web UI with voice and text input, and DAP2 satellite devices (Raspberry Pi or ESP32).

## Features

### Voice Intelligence

- **Speech Recognition** — Whisper ASR with GPU acceleration on Jetson (2.3x–5.5x faster than real-time). Intelligent voice activity detection knows when you're speaking and when you've stopped.
- **Multi-Provider LLM** — Cloud: OpenAI GPT-5, Anthropic Claude 4.6, Google Gemini 2.5/3. Local: llama.cpp or Ollama for fully offline operation. Runtime model switching via WebUI or voice.
- **Text-to-Speech** — Piper TTS with ONNX Runtime. Multiple voices included. Text preprocessing for natural phrasing.
- **Extended Thinking** — Deep reasoning mode for complex queries:
   - Claude: thinking budget control with collapsible blocks
   - OpenAI: reasoning effort (low/medium/high) for o1/o3/o4 models
   - Gemini: thinking mode for Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro
   - Local: Qwen3 thinking mode with native template support
- **Cloud Rate Limiting** — Built-in throttling prevents you from getting rate-limited by cloud providers.
- **Streaming Responses** — DAWN starts speaking while still thinking, just like a real conversation. Perceived latency drops to ~1.3 seconds.

### Multi-Room Voice (DAP2 Satellites)

- **One Server, One Port, Three Client Types** — The WebUI server on port 3000 is the single entry point for browsers, Raspberry Pi satellites, and ESP32 satellites. No extra servers or ports required.
- **Tier 1 (Raspberry Pi)** — Local ASR/TTS, hands-free with wake word. Sends only text to the server. SDL2 touchscreen UI with KMSDRM backend.
- **Tier 2 (ESP32-S3)** — Streams raw PCM audio; server handles ASR/TTS. Push-to-talk operation.
- **Music Streaming** — Stream music to every room through your Tier 1 satellites.

- **Voice & Text Input** — Push-to-talk voice and text input from any browser.
- **Real-Time Communication** — WebSocket-based with session persistence across page refreshes (30-minute timeout).
- **Settings Panel** — Live configuration editing from the browser. API keys with secure handling. Restart indicators for settings that require it.
- **User Management** — Cookie-based authentication with "Remember Me" (30-day sessions). Admin tools: create/delete users, reset passwords, unlock accounts. Per-user persona, location, timezone, units, and TTS speed preferences.
- **Conversation History** — Browse, search, continue, delete, and export (JSON/HTML) past conversations. One-click message copy. Per-conversation LLM settings (reasoning mode, tools mode).
- **7 Color Themes** — Cyan, Purple, Green, Orange, Red, Blue, and Terminal.
- **Vision & Documents** — Send images for AI analysis (upload, paste, drag-and-drop, camera capture). Attach text documents (Markdown, CSV, JSON, source code, and more) for LLM context.
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard navigation, screen reader support (ARIA), reduced motion preferences, WCAG-compliant touch targets. Mobile-friendly responsive design.
- **Debug Mode** — Toggle to view tool results, commands, and system messages.

### Smart Home & IoT

- **Home Assistant** — Control lights (on/off/brightness/color/color temperature), climate, locks, covers, media players. Activate scenes, trigger scripts and automations. Entity status queries with area-aware responses.
- **Fuzzy Name Matching** — "Turn on the living room light" works even if the entity is named slightly differently.
- **MQTT Device Control** — Extensible device callback architecture for integration with other OASIS components or external systems.

### LLM Tools

DAWN's LLM automatically invokes tools and incorporates results into responses. Multiple tool calls execute concurrently for faster answers.

- **Web Search** — Voice-activated search via SearXNG (self-hosted, privacy-focused). Categories: web, news, social, science, IT, Q&A, dictionary, academic papers. Time filtering for recent results (today, this week, this month).
- **URL Fetcher** — Fetch and read web pages. Large pages auto-summarized. Optional FlareSolverr for JavaScript-heavy sites.
- **Weather** — Real-time weather and forecasts via Open-Meteo API (free, no API key required).
- **Calculator** — Mathematical expression evaluation.
- **CalDAV Calendar** — CalDAV calendar integration (Google Calendar via OAuth 2.0, iCloud, Nextcloud, Radicale). Query today's events, search by keyword, add/update/delete events across multiple accounts. Filter queries by calendar name.
- **Email** — Multi-account IMAP/SMTP email (Gmail via OAuth 2.0, iCloud, Outlook, Fastmail, self-hosted). Check inbox, read messages, search, send with two-step confirmation, trash with confirmation, archive. Pagination for large result sets. Per-account read-only flag. Contacts system for recipient resolution.
- **Scheduler** — Timers, alarms, reminders, and scheduled tool execution.
   - "Set a 10 minute timer", "Wake me up at 7 AM", "Remind me to call Mom at 3pm"
   - Recurring events (daily, weekdays, weekends, weekly, custom days)
   - Audible chimes with configurable volume, snooze, and dismiss via voice or WebUI
   - Scheduled tasks: "Turn off the lights at midnight" (executes any registered tool)

### Persistent Memory

DAWN remembers facts, preferences, and relationships about its users across sessions — and forgets them on request.

- **Memory Tool** — "Remember that I'm vegetarian", "What do you know about me?"
- **Hybrid Search** — Finds the right memory whether you use the exact words or just describe what you're looking for. Keyword and meaning-based search working together.
- **Entity Graph** — Automatically learns the people, places, pets, and projects in your life and how they relate to each other.
- **Automated Extraction** — Facts, preferences, entities, and relations extracted at session end.
- **Privacy Toggle** — Mark conversations as private to prevent memory extraction (Ctrl+Shift+P in WebUI).
- **Confidence Decay** — Unused memories naturally fade; accessed memories are reinforced.
- **Memory Viewer** — Browse, search, and manage all memory types in the WebUI. Four tabs: Facts, Preferences, Summaries, Graph.
- **Import / Export** — Export memories as DAWN JSON (lossless backup) or human-readable text (portable). Import from Claude, ChatGPT, or other AIs — paste text or upload a file. Preview before committing with automatic duplicate detection.
- **Per-User Isolation** — Each user's memory is separate in multi-user households.

### Music Playback

- **Multi-Format** — FLAC, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis with auto-format detection and mixed-format playlists.
